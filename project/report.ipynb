    "This project aims to recommend music based on the sentiment of social media post. Within the scope of this project, I have trained a *Logistic Regression* model on tweeter post and evaluated the performace of the model to detect sentiment from social media post. The model showed 79% test accuracy. Later on, I have used the trained model to detect the sentiment of a user, and then recommend songs based on the sentiment and the user's personal playlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an era where music and social media intertwine, this endeavor seeks to revolutionize personalized music discovery. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in users' social media posts, I aim to craft a dynamic recommendation system for Spotify, tailoring playlists that resonate with the emotional context of individuals. Through the fusion of advanced sentiment analysis and machine learning, this project endeavors to enhance the user experience by delivering music that not only aligns with personal preferences but also harmonizes with the sentiments conveyed in their digital expressions."

    "\n",
    "Explainability or interpretability in machine learning or deep learning models are very essential for building trust, ensuring ethical use, complying with regulations, improving model performance, and fostering collaboration between humans and AI systems. As machine learning applications continue to impact various aspects of society, the need for transparency and interpretability becomes increasingly critical. Over the last couple of years, the term *Explainable AI* has become one of the most concering topic for researchers[2]. Many researches have been conducted to prove why explaining the *black-box* models are important [2][3][4].\n",

    "7. Fetch user's playlist songs from the SQLite DB that matches the detected sentiment in step-5.\n",
    "8. Calculate average bpm, danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, and speechiness of the songs that have been fetched in step-7.\n",
    "9. Fetch first ten songs from all songs that matches the sentiment of step-6 and the values of bpm, danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, and speechiness are greater than the average values calculated in step-8. Arrange the songs by valence's descending order.\n",
