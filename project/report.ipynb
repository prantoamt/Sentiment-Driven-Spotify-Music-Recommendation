    "This project aims to recommend music based on the sentiment of social media post. Within the scope of this project, I have trained a *Logistic Regression* model on tweeter post and evaluated the performace of the model to detect sentiment from social media post. The model showed 79% test accuracy. Later on, I have used the trained model to detect the sentiment of a user, and then recommend songs based on the sentiment and the user's personal playlist.\n",

    "In an era where music and social media intertwine, this endeavor seeks to revolutionize personalized music discovery. By analyzing the sentiment expressed in users' social media posts, I aim to craft a dynamic recommendation system for Spotify, tailoring playlists that resonate with the emotional context of individuals. Through the fusion of advanced sentiment analysis and machine learning, this project endeavors to enhance the user experience by delivering music that not only aligns with personal preferences but also harmonizes with the sentiments conveyed in their digital expressions.\n",
